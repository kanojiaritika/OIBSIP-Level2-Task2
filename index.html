          <h1>About</h1>
          <p class="about-text">
            Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941) was the youngest son of Debendranath
            Tagore, a leader of the Brahmo Samaj, which was a new religious sect
            in nineteenth-century Bengal and which attempted a revival of the
            ultimate monistic basis of Hinduism as laid down in the Upanishads.
            He was educated at home; and although at seventeen he was sent to
            England for formal schooling, he did not finish his studies there.
            In his mature years, in addition to his many-sided literary
            activities, he managed the family estates, a project which brought
            him into close touch with common humanity and increased his interest
            in social reforms. He also started an experimental school at
            Shantiniketan where he tried his Upanishadic ideals of education.
            From time to time he participated in the Indian nationalist
            movement, though in his own non-sentimental and visionary way; and
            Gandhi, the political father of modern India, was his devoted
            friend. Tagore was knighted by the ruling British Government in
            1915, but within a few years he resigned the honour as a protest
            against British policies in India.

      <h1>Works of Rabindranath Tagore</h1>
      <p>
        Known mostly for his poetry, Tagore wrote novels, essays, short stories,
        travelogues, dramas, and thousands of songs. Of Tagore's prose, his
        short stories are perhaps most highly regarded; he is indeed credited
        with originating the Bengali-language version of the genre. His works
        are frequently noted for their rhythmic, optimistic, and lyrical nature.
        Such stories mostly borrow from the lives of common people. Tagore's
        non-fiction grappled with history, linguistics, and spirituality. He
        wrote autobiographies. His travelogues, essays, and lectures were
        compiled into several volumes, including Europe Jatrir Patro (Letters
        from Europe) and Manusher Dhormo (The Religion of Man). His brief chat
        with Einstein, "Note on the Nature of Reality", is included as an
        appendix to the latter. On the occasion of Tagore's 150th birthday, an
        anthology (titled Kalanukromik Rabindra Rachanabali) of the total body
        of his works is currently being published in Bengali in chronological
        order. This includes all versions of each work and fills about eighty
        volumes.[103] In 2011, Harvard University Press collaborated with
        Visva-Bharati University to publish The Essential Tagore, the largest
        anthology of Tagore's works available in English; it was edited by
        Fakrul Alam and Radha Chakravarthy and marks the 150th anniversary of
        Tagore's birth.
